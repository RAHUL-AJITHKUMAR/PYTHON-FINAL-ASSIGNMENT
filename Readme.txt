Given a dataset from ABC company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The company requires a comprehensive report detailing information about their employees across various teams. The need detailed analysis along with graphical representation of the following:

1. Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.
2. Segregate employees based on their positions within the company.
3. Identify the predominant age group among employees.
4. Discover which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
5. Investigate if there's any correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually.


Before proceeding Preprocessing of data is required as the height column has wrong data which have to be handled also check for any null values to maintain integrity. 

After height columns are filled with random numbers and null values are handled we then proceed to the Analysis Part. 

Firstly Distribution of employees across team and corresponding percentage split are found out and I used DataFrame to have a good visual view of the data, also I have provided a Pie Chart Graphical representation for easy understanding. 

Then Employees are segregated based on the company again I used dataframe representation, I have also provided a bar chart view of the relationship as well. Which Shows SG has the maximum Employee count with 89 followed by PF.


Then we proceed for finding out which group is predominant in the company, and by analysis we can find that employees aging 18-25 is the predominant working group in the company.

Then a study is done to identify Team and position with highest salary which shows that team Los Angeles Clippers have the highest salary expenditure whereas position PG has the highest salary expenditure

Finally the correlation between Age and Salary has been graphically depicted using an interactive Visual representation.
